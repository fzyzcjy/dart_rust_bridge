## 2.0.0-dev.2

* Please refer to https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/guides/miscellaneous/whats-new for what's changed in V2.

* Please refer to https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/guides/miscellaneous/whats-new for what's changed in V2.
* The 2.0.0-dev.0 will contain bugs and missing features, because I have to have a real (pre-)release before I can start
  working on the last part of tests and functionalities. So it is a chicken-and-egg problem ;) But I expect
  2.0.0-dev.2 (or -dev.3) to be stable.

## 1.2.0

* Enable `Option<T>` types to be transformed (thanks @Desdaemon)
* Support `Stream`s: call function once, "return" multiple times with different data.
* Add `FlutterRustBridgeSetupMixin` (an optional helper class), which allows custom setup hooks before ffi can be
  executed.
* Add `hint` parameter in generated Dart code, allowing users to pass custom data to the Dart executor, thus increasing
  flexibility.
* Improve panic handling in extreme cases (avoid panic across languages, which is undefined behavior).
* Refactored `Handler`, now it is much easier to customize your own handler functionality.
* Remove one `Box::new(FnOnce)`, thus enables better inlining for ffi function calls.
* Fix bug: Dart struct(class) is not generated if the struct only appears in the return type #98.
* Add `FlutterRustBridgeTimeoutMixin`. If used, a timeout exception will be thrown for ffi calls that do not return
  within time limit.
