# Arbitrary Dart types (opaque)

Any Dart type can be passed to Rust. This is done by wrapping it with `DartOpaque`.

This library ensures that any Dart objects are always removed on the parent Dart thread.

Different from non-opaque types, opaque types are not copied/moved/reconstructed at all. For example, if you pass around a Dart object `MyObject` in arguments and return values, you will get the exact _same_ object.

## Example `DartOpaque`

Rust:

```rust,noplayground
pub fn get_dart_opaque(a: DartOpaque) { ... }
pub fn return_dart_opaque() -> DartOpaque { ... }
...
```

And use it in Dart:

```dart
var opaque = await api.getDartOpaque(() => '42');
Object answer_obj = await api.returnDartOpaque();
var fn = answer_obj as String Function();
print(fn());
```

## Implementation details

As for how it is implemented as well as the design towards safety, please refer to [this doc](../contributing/dart_opaque_type_safety.md)).
