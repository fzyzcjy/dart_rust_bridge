| `Uuid`      | `UuidValue` see package [uuid](https://pub.dev/packages/uuid) |

:warning: Please note that you need to add package [uuid](https://pub.dev/packages/uuid/install) to your Dart/Flutter dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` as well.

:bulb: `Vec<Uuid>` implementation detail : all the uuids get concatenated as a single array of bytes for performance optimization.
