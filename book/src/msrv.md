# MSRV

The MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) is the oldest version of Rust that
this crate is guaranteed to work with.

The MSRV(s) for `flutter_rust_bridge` are as follows:

| Channel | MSRV |
| ------- | ---- |
| stable  | <!-- stable msrv --> `1.64+` |
| nightly | <!-- nightly msrv --> `nightly-2022-07-15+` |

These versions are CI tested and _guaranteed_ to compile,
given there are no external error factors.

The MSRV is subject to change without prior notice in major/minor releases of `flutter_rust_bridge`,
but we do our best to keep it as low as possible.

The MSRV is also stated in the [`README.md`](/README.md).
